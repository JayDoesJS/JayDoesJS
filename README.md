Hi, I'm Jay. I code for a living and make videos for fun. I run a few YouTube channels:
- [JayHappyDiary](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2CFwR7Es3JVCb_45TGcm8w) - a personal "vlog" where I document the things I do, be it code or life in general.
- [JayDoesJS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh2cSxu4MsOZkRjl6b-rdBQ) - a channel focused entirely on showcasing JavaScript.

Here you will find most of the code I show in my videos.
